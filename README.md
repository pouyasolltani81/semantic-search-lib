# Semantic Search Library

A flexible library for semantic search supporting multiple backends (cosine similarity, FAISS, ScaNN, Chroma DB). It allows you to ingest CSV data, format it with custom templates, use either pre-trained or custom models, and perform similarity searches. The library is usable as both a standard Python package and via a command-line interface (CLI).

## Features

- **Data Ingestion:** Import CSV files and define custom templates (e.g., "`{name} {family} has the age: {age}`").
- **Multiple Similarity Backends:** Choose from native cosine similarity, FAISS, ScaNN (optional), or Chroma DB.
- **Flexible Model Options:** Use pre-trained SentenceTransformer models or load your own custom model.
- **Dual Interface:** Use as a library in your own projects or interact via a CLI.
- **Web API Example:** A sample FastAPI server is provided (`main.py`).

## Installation

Clone the repository and install in editable mode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/semantic-search-lib.git
cd semantic-search-lib
pip install -e .
Note:

If you want to use the ScaNN backend, follow the instructions in semantic_search/backends/scann_backend.py (ScaNN may require manual installation).
If you want to use the ChromaDB backend, install it with:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install chromadb
Usage as a Library
Import and use the library in your Python project:

python
Copy
Edit
from semantic_search import SemanticSearch

# Initialize the search engine with your desired backend and model
search_engine = SemanticSearch(backend="faiss", model_name="all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

# Build the index from a CSV file using a custom template
search_engine.build_index_from_csv("data.csv", "{name} {family} has the age: {age}")

# Perform a search query
distances, indices = search_engine.query("John Doe has the age: 30", top_k=5)
print("Distances:", distances)
print("Indices:", indices)
Usage via CLI
1. Build the Index
bash
Copy
Edit
python cli.py index \
  --csv data.csv \
  --template "{name} {family} has the age: {age}" \
  --backend faiss \
  --model_name all-MiniLM-L6-v2
2. Perform a Search
bash
Copy
Edit
python cli.py search --query "John Doe has the age: 30" --top_k 5
Running the FastAPI Server
Start the API server with:

bash
Copy
Edit
uvicorn main:app --reload
Available endpoints:

POST /index/: Build the index by providing JSON with keys csv_path, template, backend, model (optional), and model_name.
POST /search/: Perform a search by providing JSON with query and top_k.
